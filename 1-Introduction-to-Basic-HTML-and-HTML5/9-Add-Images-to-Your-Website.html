<!--learned that if the img src is not inside closed brackets, the h2 element is rendered useless. Also, using an alt increases accessability in case the img does not load by providing a description.-->
<!--Also, was not instructed on how or why putting the img element inside of the main element is important as well as leaving the h2 element outside of the main element. What you see are the results of following the language of the instructions as they were provided.-->
