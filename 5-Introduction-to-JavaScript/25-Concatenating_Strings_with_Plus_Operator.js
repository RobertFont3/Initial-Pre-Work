<!--concatenated strings using + and discovered that to include spaces in the text between added elements one must add the space before the closing quotes of the first string-->

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr;

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
