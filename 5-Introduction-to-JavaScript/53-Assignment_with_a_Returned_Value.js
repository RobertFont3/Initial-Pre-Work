//had a bit of difficulty understanding the equasion to get results. I knew how to call but honestly had to play with numbers to attatch to processArg to get the right answer. I will research this


// Example
var changed = 0;

function change(num) {
  return (num + 5) / 3;
}

changed = change(10);

// Setup
var processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code below this line
processed = processArg(7);
