<!--learned that with css, changes made to multiple elements can be changed much more quickly than if one had to go through and change each element individually
using html. I dont like when the curvy brackets are all over the place and the way I have it here seems much more streamlined. I have wondered why I keep seeing
the curvy brackets above and below the affected elements-->


<style>
  .red-text
  {color: red;}
